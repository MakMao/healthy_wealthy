    title: 'What is protein?',
    info: 'Protein is one of three macronutrients the body needs to sustain life. Smaller components called amino acids are linked together to form different proteins, and when we consume these proteins, the amino acids are broken down and subsequently reformed into the building blocks our body needs in order to function properly.'

    title: 'Should I be taking a protein powder supplement?',
    info: 'Absolutely, unless you can get enough protein from whole foods in your diet, which is rarely the case for anyone who regularly works out. And even then, a protein shake post-exercise is much more effective than eating food because the protein can be digested, absorbed and utilized at a faster rate.'

    title: 'When is the best times to have a protein shake?',
